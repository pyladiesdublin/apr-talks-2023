## TALK: How to test Machine Learning code in Python?

(30 minutes) The aim of this presentation is to illustrate the process of unit testing machine learning code using Python. Although unit testing is a familiar practice among software engineers, it is equally important for data scientists to employ it. The first segment of the talk will be a brief overview of the theory and objectives of unit testing. In the second part, I will provide practical examples of using pytest to test functions which relate to machine learning problems. I will demonstrate how to create a basic test for these types of functions, as well as a parameterized test, a mock, and a fixture.
